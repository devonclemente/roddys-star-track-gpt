# Review Tests

Enforce black-box, behavior-driven test standards. Tests describe what the system does, not how it does it. Assertions should read like truths about the system, not line-by-line reenactments of implementation.

## Trigger

Activate when:
- User runs `/review-tests`
- Reviewing unit tests or integration tests
- Writing new tests
- Refactoring or assessing existing tests

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Describe Behaviors, Not Methods

Test names should read like specifications. They describe outcomes, not implementation.

- Name tests as behaviors: `"user can checkout with valid payment"`
- Avoid method names: `"test_processPayment_returns_true"`
- Use domain language, not code language
- Assertions should match outcomes, not internal state

### 2. Decouple from Implementation

Tests should survive refactoring. If you rename a private method, no test should break.

- Never import or reference private/internal functions
- Don't assert on intermediate state or transient variables
- Mock at boundaries (APIs, databases, file system), not internal collaborators
- Avoid testing "how" — test "what"

### 3. Arrange – Act – Assert

Every test follows this structure. No exceptions.

```typescript
// Arrange: Set up only what is necessary
const cart = createCart();
cart.addItem({ id: 'SKU-001', price: 29.99 });

// Act: Execute exactly one action
const total = cart.calculateTotal();

// Assert: Verify externally observable behavior
expect(total).toBe(29.99);
```

Separate each section with a blank line. One Act per test. Clean setup, single action, assertions that read like truths.

### 4. Test Boundaries, Not Internals

Public API is the contract. Internals are implementation details.

- Test through public interfaces only
- Don't reach into private state
- Don't mock what you own (mock what you don't control)
- Focus on: edge cases, error cases, limits, thresholds, invalid input handling

### 5. Use Meaningful Assertions

Assertions should fail with useful messages. They verify behavior, not existence.

- Assert on outcomes, not on calls made
- Prefer specific matchers: `toEqual`, `toContain`, `toThrow`
- Avoid `toBeTruthy()` when `toBe(true)` is what you mean
- Avoid tautological assertions or noise
- One logical assertion per test (multiple `expect` calls fine if testing one concept)

---

## Review Checklist

When reviewing a test file, verify:

- [ ] Test name clearly expresses behavior in plain language
- [ ] Arranges only what is necessary (no irrelevant setup)
- [ ] Exactly one main action in the Act phase
- [ ] Assertions reflect externally observable behavior
- [ ] No references to private methods or internal state
- [ ] Mocks used only at external boundaries
- [ ] Would survive refactoring while still validating the same behavior
- [ ] Readable by someone who does not know the implementation
- [ ] Edge cases and error paths are covered
- [ ] No shared mutable state between tests
- [ ] Meaningfully improves confidence (not noise)

---

## Red Flags

Immediately flag these anti-patterns:

| Red Flag | Problem |
|----------|---------|
| `test('processData works')` | Vague name; describes nothing |
| `expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(3)` | Testing implementation order |
| Importing from `../utils/internal` | Coupling to internals |
| `jest.spyOn(obj, 'privateMethod')` | Testing private methods |
| `beforeEach` mutating shared state | Flaky tests waiting to happen |
| `expect(result).toBeTruthy()` | Weak assertion; hides real bugs |
| `test.skip` or `xtest` without issue link | Dead code or hidden failures |
| Copy-pasted test blocks | Missing abstraction or parameterization |
| Mocking the class under test | You're not testing anything real |
| `await sleep(1000)` | Flaky timing-dependent test |
| Asserting on intermediate variables | Implementation coupling |
| Large setup blocks with irrelevant details | Noise obscuring intent |
| Multiple behaviors in a single test | Lacks focus; hard to debug |
| Assertions that restate the implementation | Tautological; proves nothing |

---

## Questions to Ask

When reviewing tests, ask:

1. **"What behavior is being validated?"**
   - If unclear, the test lacks focus.

2. **"Can I understand the behavior from the test name alone?"**
   - If no, the name needs work.

3. **"Could this test be rewritten in plain English as user-visible behavior?"**
   - Tests should describe what users/consumers experience.

4. **"If I refactor the internals, would this test still hold true?"**
   - If no, the test is coupled to implementation.

5. **"Would this test catch a real bug?"**
   - If "maybe" or "it depends," the assertion is weak.

6. **"Could this test pass even if the feature is broken?"**
   - If yes, the assertion doesn't verify the right thing.

7. **"Is this testing our code or a library's code?"**
   - Don't test that `Array.map` works.

8. **"Does this test meaningfully improve confidence, or is it noise?"**
   - Every test should earn its place.

9. **"What happens when this test fails — will the error message help?"**
   - Assertions should fail clearly.

## Examples

### Bad: Testing Implementation

```typescript
// Testing method calls, not behavior
test('processOrder calls validateItems and calculateTotal', () => {
  const order = new Order(mockItems);
  const validateSpy = jest.spyOn(order, 'validateItems');
  const calculateSpy = jest.spyOn(order, 'calculateTotal');

  order.processOrder();

  expect(validateSpy).toHaveBeenCalled();
  expect(calculateSpy).toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```

**Problems:**
- Tests that methods are called, not that the order is processed
- Breaks if you refactor internal flow
- Doesn't verify the actual outcome

### Good: Testing Behavior

```typescript
// Testing the outcome of processing an order
test('processing an order with valid items returns a confirmed order', () => {
  const order = new Order([
    { sku: 'WIDGET-01', quantity: 2, price: 15.00 }
  ]);

  const result = order.process();

  expect(result.status).toBe('confirmed');
  expect(result.total).toBe(30.00);
});
```

**Why it's better:**
- Tests the public contract
- Survives internal refactoring
- Describes business behavior
- Verifies meaningful outcome

---

### Bad: Vague Test Name + Weak Assertion

```typescript
test('handleSubmit works', async () => {
  const result = await handleSubmit(formData);
  expect(result).toBeTruthy();
});
```

**Problems:**
- Name says nothing about expected behavior
- `toBeTruthy()` passes for `{}`, `[]`, `1`, `"error"`, etc.
- No clear specification

### Good: Specific Name + Precise Assertion

```typescript
test('submitting valid form data creates a new user account', async () => {
  const formData = { email: 'test@example.com', password: 'secure123' };

  const result = await handleSubmit(formData);

  expect(result).toEqual({
    success: true,
    userId: expect.any(String),
  });
});
```

**Why it's better:**
- Test name is a specification
- Assertion is precise and structural
- Fails clearly if behavior changes

---

### Bad: Testing Through Internals

```typescript
import { _parseConfig } from '../config/parser'; // internal export

test('parseConfig extracts database URL', () => {
  const result = _parseConfig(rawConfig);
  expect(result.dbUrl).toBe('postgres://...');
});
```

**Problems:**
- Imports internal function
- Test breaks if you reorganize internals
- Bypasses the real entry point

### Good: Testing Through Public API

```typescript
import { loadConfig } from '../config';

test('configuration includes database connection settings', () => {
  const config = loadConfig('test.env');

  expect(config.database.url).toBe('postgres://localhost/test');
  expect(config.database.poolSize).toBe(5);
});
```

**Why it's better:**
- Uses public API
- Tests what consumers actually use
- Resilient to internal changes

---

### Bad: Multiple Behaviors in One Test

```typescript
test('user authentication', async () => {
  // Testing login
  const loginResult = await auth.login('user@test.com', 'password');
  expect(loginResult.token).toBeDefined();

  // Testing token refresh
  const refreshResult = await auth.refresh(loginResult.token);
  expect(refreshResult.token).toBeDefined();

  // Testing logout
  await auth.logout(refreshResult.token);
  const status = await auth.checkSession(refreshResult.token);
  expect(status.valid).toBe(false);
});
```

**Problems:**
- Three behaviors crammed into one test
- If it fails, which behavior broke?
- Hard to maintain and understand

### Good: One Behavior Per Test

```typescript
test('valid credentials return an authentication token', async () => {
  const result = await auth.login('user@test.com', 'password');

  expect(result.token).toMatch(/^[A-Za-z0-9-_]+\.[A-Za-z0-9-_]+\.[A-Za-z0-9-_]+$/);
});

test('logout invalidates the session', async () => {
  const { token } = await auth.login('user@test.com', 'password');

  await auth.logout(token);

  const status = await auth.checkSession(token);
  expect(status.valid).toBe(false);
});
```

**Why it's better:**
- Each test validates one behavior
- Failures are immediately diagnostic
- Easy to understand and maintain

---

## Rationale

Tests are specifications. They document what the system does and protect against regressions. When tests are coupled to implementation:

- **Refactoring becomes painful** — every internal change breaks tests
- **False confidence** — tests pass but don't verify real behavior
- **Maintenance burden** — you're testing implementation twice

Black-box tests treat the system as a consumer would. They verify contracts, not wiring. They survive refactors, catch real bugs, and serve as living documentation.

Write tests that answer: *"Does this system behave correctly?"* — not *"Does this code execute in the order I expect?"*

A test should be readable by someone who has never seen the implementation. If understanding the test requires understanding the code, the test has failed as documentation.
